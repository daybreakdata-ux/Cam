The contents of the file `/Cam/Cam/public/app.js` are already provided in your initial message. Since you requested to deploy the project to Vercel, you may need to ensure that the `vercel.json` file is correctly set up for deployment. 

If you need to create or modify the `vercel.json` file, please let me know, and I can assist with that. Otherwise, you can proceed with the deployment using the existing files.
